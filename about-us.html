          <h2>About The Club</h2>
          <p>CU Cornhole Club was founded by Matthew Lenneman and Lincoln Rychecky. One day in the winter of 2018, they were sitting in business class and Matt asked Lincoln "Hey, want to start a cornhole club?" Lincoln replied "sure, sounds kind of fun." Just like that, CU Cornhole was born</p>
          <p>CU Cornhole Club had its first meeting February 14, 2019 on a cold Thursday afternoon in the Geology building. Lincoln, Matt, and three other brave souls attended the meeting and chartered the original club constitution/ mission statement. With nothing but two sets of boards and a dream, the club was officially in business.</p>
          <p>Since then, CU Cornhole and its members have thrown tens of thousands of bags, competed in the ACL Collegiate National Championship every year, hosted plenty of campus tournaments, and grown into a community of hundreds of bag throwers on campus united by our love for cornhole. The members have changed over the years, but the original vision still persists.</p>
          <p>In the words of the club's first president, Matt, the purpose of CU Cornhole is simple. "We're here for students on campus to have a place to go and have some fun once a week. That is it."</p>
